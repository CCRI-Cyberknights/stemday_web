# 🌟 `stemday2025` Contributor Guide (Admin-Only)

Welcome to the **CCRI CyberKnights STEM Day VM Project!** 🎉  
This repository powers a custom **Parrot Linux Capture The Flag (CTF)** experience for high school students.  

👥 **This repo is for CCRI CyberKnights club members only.**  
It contains all the source files, admin tools, and workflows for building and maintaining the **student-facing bundle**.  

📝 **Note:** Students will later receive a **separate public bundle** containing only the CTF challenges and launcher, without any admin tools or scripts.

## 🛠 Admin Workflow

### 📥 Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CCRI-Cyberknights/stemday2025.git
cd stemday2025
```

### 🌱 Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-changes
```

### 📝 Edit and Test

* Modify scripts, admin tools, or challenge folders.  
* Test your changes in:  
  - **Folder mode** (launch scripts directly).  
  - **Web portal mode** (rebuild student portal and test).  

### 🔄 Build the Student Bundle

To generate the student-facing version (removes admin tools):  

```bash
cd CCRI_CTF/web_version_admin/create_website
./build_web_version.sh
```

This creates an obfuscated, student-ready web portal in `CCRI_CTF/web_version/`.  

### 💾 Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new challenge or fix admin tool"
git push origin feature/my-changes
```

### 🔀 Open a Pull Request (PR)

1. Go to the repo on GitHub.  
2. Click **“Compare & pull request.”**  
3. Describe your changes.  
4. Submit for review and merging.

## 🛡️ Rules for Contributors

✅ Keep admin-only flags and tools **out of `web_version/`**  
✅ Test all scripts from both folder mode and web portal mode  
✅ Use relative paths (avoid absolute paths) for portability  
✅ Don’t commit generated `.pyc` files or student-only builds  

---

## 📣 About the Public Bundle

Students will receive a **separate public folder** containing only the web portal, challenges, and the desktop launcher.  
This repo stays **private** for club development and admin workflows.
