# 🌟 `stemday2025` Project README (Admin-Only)

Welcome to the **CCRI CyberKnights STEM Day VM Project!** 🎉  
This repository powers a custom **Parrot Linux Capture The Flag (CTF)** experience designed for high school students.  

👥 **This repo is for CCRI CyberKnights club members only.**  
It contains all the source files, admin tools, and scripts used to **build and maintain** the student-facing version of the CTF.  

📝 **If you’re preparing the VM for students:**  
The *student version* includes only the **essential challenge files and launcher**, without admin tools or developer resources. That bundle is auto-generated by our tools and placed in the VM’s `Desktop` folder.  

To download Parrot Linux for testing: https://www.parrotsec.org/download/

## 🚀 Preparing the Student VM

To make the CTF experience accessible to students:  

1. Use the **admin tools** in this repo to generate the student bundle:  

   ```bash
   cd CCRI_CTF/web_version_admin/create_website
   ./build_web_version.sh
   ```  

   This will obfuscate flags and build the student web portal in `CCRI_CTF/web_version/`.  

2. Copy the **`CCRI_CTF/` folder** and the **`Launch CCRI CTF Hub.desktop`** shortcut to the **Desktop** of the student VM.  

3. On the VM desktop:  
   - Right-click **Launch CCRI CTF Hub.desktop** → **Properties → Permissions**  
   - ✅ Check *“Allow this file to run as a program”*  

   This shortcut launches the student hub in a browser.

## 🛠 Admin Workflow (Quick Reference)

- **Build student hub (web portal):**

  ```bash
  cd CCRI_CTF/web_version_admin/create_website
  ./build_web_version.sh
  ```

- **Test in folder mode and web portal mode** before distributing.  
- Keep student-only bundles **separate from admin tools**.

## 🙌 Club Member Guidelines

✅ Keep admin-only flags and tools **out of `web_version/`**  
✅ Test all scripts thoroughly before release  
✅ Use relative paths for portability  
✅ Don’t commit `.pyc` files or student-only builds
