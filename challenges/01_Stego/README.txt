🕵️ Stego Decode Challenge
--------------------------

Your mission: extract a secret flag hidden inside an image file.  

The picture looks completely normal, but it’s been altered using *steganography* — a technique for hiding data inside files.  

🔧 You’ll use `steghide`, a tool that extracts hidden content (if you supply the correct password).  

💡 **Hint:** The password is the most common one in the world.  

📂 Files in this folder:
- `squirrel.jpg` – The suspicious image.
- `extract_flag.sh` – A helper script that guides you through the process.
- (The flag will be saved as `flag.txt` when you succeed.)

🏁 Flag format: **CCRI-AAAA-1111**
