# 🧩 Base64 Decode Challenge

You’ve intercepted a suspicious message from a compromised system.  

The file `encoded.txt` contains a block of strange-looking text — but the pattern suggests **Base64**, a common encoding scheme that turns binary data into readable characters.  

---

🔧 **Base64 isn’t encryption:**  
It’s just a way to encode data for safe transport. Anyone with the right tool can reverse it.  

💡 **Hint:** The message is only one step away from being readable.

## 📂 Files in this folder:
- `encoded.txt` – The encoded message.
- `decode_base64.sh` – A helper script to guide you through decoding.
- (The decoded result will be saved as `decoded_output.txt`.)
