🔐 ROT13 Decode Challenge
--------------------------

An intercepted note was found in the logs of a compromised account. It’s readable… sort of. But every letter seems slightly off — like the alphabet has been twisted.  

This challenge introduces **ROT13**, a simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter 13 places.  
- 🔄 It’s symmetrical: applying ROT13 twice restores the original message.  
- 🕵️‍♂️ While not secure by today’s standards, it’s still used to obscure text from casual readers.  

📂 Files in this folder:
- `cipher.txt` – The scrambled message.
- `decode_rot13.sh` – A helper script that guides you through decoding.  
- (The decoded result will be saved as `decoded_output.txt`.)  

💡 **Hint:** The flag will stand out in the format **CCRI-AAAA-1111**.  

🏁 Flag format: **CCRI-AAAA-1111**
