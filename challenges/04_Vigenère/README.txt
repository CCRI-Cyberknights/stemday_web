🧩 Vigenère Cipher Challenge
-----------------------------

You’ve recovered a scrambled message from an intercepted communication. Analysts suspect it was encoded using the **Vigenère cipher** — a classic encryption method that scrambles letters based on a repeating keyword.  

🧠 **Your mission:** Decrypt the message and recover the real agency flag.  

🔐 **Hint:**  
What’s the opposite of logout?  
👉 Try that word as a possible keyword for decoding.  

📂 Files in this folder:
- `cipher.txt` – The encrypted message.
- `break_vigenere.sh` – A helper script that guides you through decoding.  

🚨 **Note:** Not every decoded result will be valid.  
Only one flag fits the official format: **CCRI-AAAA-1111**.  

Good luck, Agent. 🕵️
