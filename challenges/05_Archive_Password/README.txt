🔐 ZIP File Crack & Decode
---------------------------

You’ve recovered a mysterious ZIP archive: `secret.zip`.  

It’s password-protected — and the password isn’t obvious. Luckily, a wordlist of possible passwords (`wordlist.txt`) was also found. Only one of them works.  

Inside the archive lies a **Base64-encoded** message. It contains several flag-like strings, but only one matches the official agency format.  

🧠 **Your mission:**  
1. Run the helper script: `crack_zip.sh`  
2. The script will automatically try each password in the wordlist.  
3. Once cracked, it will extract and decode the hidden message.  
4. Review the results and identify the **real flag**.  

💡 **Tip:** Watch as the wordlist scrolls — this shows how brute-force tools work in practice!
