🧠 Challenge 09: Fix the Flag! (Bash Edition)
==============================================

You’ve discovered a **broken Bash script** that’s supposed to print the agency’s flag — but something’s gone wrong.  

Right now it only prints a **two-digit number** at the end instead of a full flag. Your mission is to analyze the buggy code and fix it so the correct flag appears.  

🛠️ **What you’ll do:**  
1. Run the interactive helper: `fix_flag.sh`  
2. Inspect the broken Bash logic.  
3. Choose the correct operation to repair the calculation.  
4. Reveal and save the real flag.

- `fix_flag.sh` → Your guided code-fixing assistant  

🚩 **Flag format:** `CCRI-AAAA-1111`
