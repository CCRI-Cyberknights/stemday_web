🧠 Challenge 10: Metadata Mystery
=================================

You’ve recovered a suspicious image file: `capybara.jpg`.  

It looks normal at first glance, but investigators suspect the **flag is hidden in the metadata** — information stored *inside* the file but not visible in the picture itself.  

Your mission is to inspect the metadata and uncover the correct flag.  

⚠️ **Be careful:**  
The image contains 4 **fake flags** and only 1 real one. Look for the flag that fits the agency’s official format and feels legitimate.  

🛠️ **Tool Hint:** `exiftool`  
This tool extracts hidden metadata from image files.  

📂 **Files in this folder:**  
- `capybara.jpg` → Image containing hidden metadata  

🚩 **Flag format:** `CCRI-AAAA-1111`
