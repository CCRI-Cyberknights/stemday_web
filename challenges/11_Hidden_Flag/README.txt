🧠 Challenge 11: Hidden File Hunt
=================================

Somewhere in this folder structure lies a **hidden file** containing the real agency flag.  

But beware — four **fake flags** have been planted to confuse intruders. Only one follows the official format.  

🎯 **Your Mission:**  
Explore the directory tree, uncover hidden files, and locate the *one* valid flag.  

✅ Official flag format: `CCRI-AAAA-1111`  
❌ Fake flags may look similar but use the wrong prefix or order:  
   - `FLAG-HIDE-####`  
   - `HIDE-####-CODE`  
   - etc.  

🛠️ **Tools at your disposal:**  
- `find`, `ls -a`, `cat` — search for hidden files manually  
- Or use the interactive helper script:  
  `./search_for_flag.sh`  

📂 **Folder to explore:** `junk/`

👀 Look carefully. The real flag isn’t always in the obvious place.
