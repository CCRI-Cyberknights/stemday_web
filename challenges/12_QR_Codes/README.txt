🧠 Challenge 12: QR Code Decode
===============================

This folder contains **five mysterious QR code images**.  
Only ONE of them hides the real agency flag.

🎯 **Your Mission:**  
1. View and scan each QR code using the helper script.  
2. Examine the decoded results carefully.  
3. Identify the *one* valid flag in this format:  
   `CCRI-AAAA-1111`  
4. Submit it to the scoreboard.  

🛠️ **How to Begin:**  
• Run the interactive script:  
  `./explore_qr.sh`  

• The script will:  
  - Open each QR code image for 20 seconds.  
  - Allow you to scan it with your phone (optional).  
  - Automatically decode the QR content and save results to `qr_results.txt`.  

⚠️ **Watch out:**  
The other QR codes contain distractions. Only one result follows the official format.

💡 *Pro Tip:* Focus on the decoded strings. Fake flags often have the wrong prefix or structure.
